# This recipe implements the full deliberate development lifecycle:
#
# 1. Workspace Creation - Create fresh directory with git, AGENTS.md, submodules
# 2. Context Gathering - Understand relevant codebase areas
# 3. Deliberate Design - Decompose, explore, generalize, specify
# 4. Implementation - Build with validation implicit
# 5. Validation - Kick the tires in real usage
# 6. Cleanup - Document and prepare for workspace destruction
#
# This mirrors the workflow pattern:
# - Fresh workspace per task (actually created, not just conceptual)
# - Thorough planning before implementation
# - Validation is implicit, not separate
# - Workspace is throwaway, knowledge persists
#
# Typical runtime: 15-45 minutes depending on feature complexity
# Best for: Medium-sized features that warrant full deliberate treatment
#
# Usage:
#   "run the feature-development recipe for: [feature description]"
#   "execute feature-development with feature_name='plan-mode' repo='amplifier-app-cli'"

steps:
  # Step 1: Create workspace directory structure
  - id: "create-workspace"
    agent: "foundation:file-ops"
    prompt: |
      CREATE WORKSPACE
      ================
      
      Create a fresh workspace for feature development.
      
      Feature name: {{feature_name}}
      Base directory: {{workspace_base}}
      
      {{#if repo}}
      Primary repo: {{repo}}
      {{/if}}
      
      {{#if related_repos}}
      Related repos: {{related_repos}}
      {{/if}}
      
      Execute these steps:
      
      1. **Create workspace directory**
         ```bash
         mkdir -p {{workspace_base}}/{{feature_name}}
         cd {{workspace_base}}/{{feature_name}}
         ```
      
      2. **Initialize git repository**
         ```bash
         git init
         git commit --allow-empty -m "Initialize workspace for {{feature_name}}"
         ```
      
      3. **Create AGENTS.md working memory**
         Create file AGENTS.md with this content:
         ```markdown
         # {{feature_name}} Workspace
         
         ## Current Focus
         {{feature_description}}
         
         ## Key Decisions
         [To be filled during planning]
         
         ## Open Questions
         [To be filled during planning]
         
         ## Notes
         Created: [timestamp]
         ```
      
      4. **Add repos as submodules** (if provided)
         {{#if repo}}
         ```bash
         git submodule add {{repo}} repos/primary
         ```
         {{/if}}
         {{#if related_repos}}
         For each repo in the comma-separated list, add as submodule:
         ```bash
         git submodule add [repo_url] repos/[repo_name]
         ```
         {{/if}}
      
      5. **Create .amplifier directory**
         ```bash
         mkdir -p .amplifier
         ```
      
      6. **Commit workspace setup**
         ```bash
         git add -A
         git commit -m "Setup workspace structure"
         ```
      
      Report:
      - Full path to created workspace
      - Git status showing clean state
      - List of submodules added (if any)
      - Confirmation workspace is ready
    output: "workspace_path"
    timeout: 300

  # Step 2: Gather codebase context
  - id: "gather-context"
    agent: "foundation:explorer"
    prompt: |
      GATHER WORKSPACE CONTEXT
      ========================
      
      Workspace: {{workspace_path}}
      Feature: {{feature_name}}
      Description: {{feature_description}}
      
      {{#if repo}}
      Primary repo: {{repo}}
      {{/if}}
      
      {{#if related_repos}}
      Related repos: {{related_repos}}
      {{/if}}
      
      Survey the codebase to gather context for this feature:
      
      1. **Identify relevant files** - What existing code relates to this feature?
      
      2. **Find patterns** - Are there similar features we can learn from?
      
      3. **Note dependencies** - What will this feature interact with?
      
      4. **Check for conflicts** - Is anything else touching this area?
      
      Update the workspace AGENTS.md with key findings.
      
      Provide a concise context summary (not exhaustive exploration).
    output: "workspace_context"
    timeout: 300

  # Step 3: Problem decomposition
  - id: "decompose"
    agent: "deliberate-development:deliberate-planner"
    prompt: |
      PROBLEM DECOMPOSITION
      =====================
      
      Workspace: {{workspace_path}}
      Feature: {{feature_name}}
      Description: {{feature_description}}
      
      {{#if constraints}}
      Constraints: {{constraints}}
      {{/if}}
      
      Workspace context:
      {{workspace_context}}
      
      Decompose this feature:
      
      1. **Core need** - What is the essential problem being solved?
      
      2. **Components** - What pieces make up this feature?
      
      3. **User story** - How will users interact with this?
      
      4. **Success criteria** - How do we know it's done?
      
      5. **Scope boundaries** - What's explicitly NOT included?
      
      Update AGENTS.md with decomposition notes.
    output: "decomposition"
    timeout: 300

  # Step 4: Solution exploration
  - id: "explore-solutions"
    agent: "deliberate-development:deliberate-planner"
    prompt: |
      SOLUTION EXPLORATION
      ====================
      
      Feature: {{feature_name}}
      Workspace: {{workspace_path}}
      
      Decomposition:
      {{decomposition}}
      
      Explore 2-3 approaches:
      
      For each, provide:
      - Approach summary
      - Implementation complexity (Low/Medium/High)
      - Integration complexity (Low/Medium/High)
      - Pros and cons
      - Risk factors
      
      Consider:
      - Direct implementation vs. generalized solution
      - Building new vs. extending existing
      - Configuration-driven vs. hard-coded
      
      Update AGENTS.md with options considered.
    output: "solution_exploration"
    timeout: 300

  # Step 5: Generalization check (the key insight step)
  - id: "generalization-check"
    agent: "deliberate-development:deliberate-planner"
    prompt: |
      GENERALIZATION CHECK
      ====================
      
      Feature: {{feature_name}}
      Description: {{feature_description}}
      Workspace: {{workspace_path}}
      
      Decomposition:
      {{decomposition}}
      
      Solutions explored:
      {{solution_exploration}}
      
      This is the "oooh, what else would be smart" moment.
      
      Consider:
      
      1. **Is this a pattern?** - Could other features use similar approach?
      
      2. **Mode potential** - Could this become a "mode" (command + instruction + rules)?
      
      3. **Reuse opportunity** - Should this be a shared component?
      
      4. **Configuration vs code** - Could this be data-driven?
      
      5. **Future extensions** - What might want to build on this?
      
      Recommendation: Should we generalize? How much? Why or why not?
      
      Be honest about over-engineering risk vs. legitimate reuse value.
      
      Update AGENTS.md with generalization decision.
    output: "generalization_decision"
    timeout: 600

  # Step 6: Create specification
  - id: "create-spec"
    agent: "foundation:zen-architect"
    mode: "ARCHITECT"
    prompt: |
      CREATE FEATURE SPECIFICATION
      ============================
      
      Feature: {{feature_name}}
      Description: {{feature_description}}
      Workspace: {{workspace_path}}
      
      Analysis results:
      - Decomposition: {{decomposition}}
      - Solutions explored: {{solution_exploration}}
      - Generalization decision: {{generalization_decision}}
      
      Create a complete implementation specification:
      
      ## Feature: {{feature_name}}
      
      ### Overview
      [What and why]
      
      ### Components
      [Each component with purpose, contract, location]
      
      ### Implementation Order
      [What to build first, second, etc.]
      
      ### Integration Points
      [How this connects to existing code]
      
      ### Test Plan
      [How to verify each component and the whole]
      
      ### Definition of Done
      [Specific, verifiable criteria]
      
      Write the specification to {{workspace_path}}/SPEC.md
    output: "feature_spec"
    timeout: 600

  # Step 7: Implementation
  - id: "implement"
    agent: "deliberate-development:deliberate-implementer"
    prompt: |
      IMPLEMENT FEATURE
      =================
      
      Feature: {{feature_name}}
      Workspace: {{workspace_path}}
      
      Specification:
      {{feature_spec}}
      
      Implement this feature following the specification exactly.
      
      Remember:
      - Validation is implicit - verify as you build
      - Complete each component before moving on
      - No TODOs or placeholders
      - Report issues rather than improvising
      - Commit progress to workspace git as you go
      
      Provide:
      1. What was created (files, components)
      2. How it was validated
      3. Any issues encountered
      4. Git log showing commits made
    output: "implementation_result"
    timeout: 900

  # Step 8: Integration validation
  - id: "validate"
    agent: "foundation:zen-architect"
    mode: "REVIEW"
    prompt: |
      VALIDATE FEATURE
      ================
      
      Feature: {{feature_name}}
      Workspace: {{workspace_path}}
      
      Specification:
      {{feature_spec}}
      
      Implementation result:
      {{implementation_result}}
      
      Validate this implementation:
      
      1. **Spec compliance** - Does it match the specification?
      
      2. **Integration** - Does it work with existing code?
      
      3. **Edge cases** - Were important edge cases handled?
      
      4. **Quality** - Code quality, no placeholders, proper tests?
      
      5. **Documentation** - Is it clear how to use this?
      
      Provide:
      - PASS/FAIL verdict
      - Issues found (if any)
      - Recommendations for improvement (if any)
    output: "validation_result"
    timeout: 300

  # Step 9: Summary for handoff
  - id: "summarize"
    agent: "foundation:explorer"
    prompt: |
      FEATURE DEVELOPMENT SUMMARY
      ===========================
      
      Feature: {{feature_name}}
      Description: {{feature_description}}
      Workspace: {{workspace_path}}
      
      Implementation: {{implementation_result}}
      Validation: {{validation_result}}
      
      Create a brief summary for handoff:
      
      ## What Was Built
      [Components created]
      
      ## Key Decisions Made
      [Important choices and why]
      
      ## How to Use
      [Brief usage guide]
      
      ## What's Next
      [Follow-up tasks if any]
      
      ## Workspace Status
      - Path: {{workspace_path}}
      - Ready to push changes to real repos
      - Safe to destroy after pushing
      
      Update AGENTS.md with final summary.
      
      Keep it concise - this is for documentation, not exploration.
    output: "feature_summary"
    timeout: 120
