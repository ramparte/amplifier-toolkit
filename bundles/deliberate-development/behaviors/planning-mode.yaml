  description: Planning mode behavior - restricts tool usage and adds planning context when in planning mode

# Context injection when planning mode is active
context:
  include:
    - context/planning-mode-instructions.md

# Note: This behavior defines the CONCEPT of planning mode.
# Actual mode switching would require a hook implementation.
# For now, this provides the context and patterns for planning-focused work.

# The planning mode concept:
# - Visual indicator: [plan] > prompt
# - Tool restrictions: warn on write operations
# - Context injection: planning-specific instructions
# - Command toggle: /plan to enter/exit

# Future hook implementation would:
# 1. Intercept tool calls
# 2. Check if in planning mode
# 3. If write operation: warn/block first attempt, allow second
# 4. Inject mode context into system prompt
